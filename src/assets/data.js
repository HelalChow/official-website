His influence spans multiple fronts from his ‚ÄúZuck‚Äù mentorship group focused on creating a web portfolio and crafting a resume & LinkedIn profile to connecting me with early tech programs, such as the Capital One Summit, and preparing me for interviews that would lead to my first internship as a sophomore. Through the time I‚Äôve known Yasin, he has provided me with advice for internships and visions for a career in software engineering. On the tech side, I‚Äôve worked with Yasin on multiple hackathon projects during HackNYU, HackRPI, and CodePath iOS bootcamp where I learned about the technical aspects and practices in real world applications. No doubt, Yasin has been beneficial in my early career efforts of which was landing my first internship this past summer."

He has helped me immensely throughout my undergraduate career for technical interviews at top companies. Helal personally polished my resume - from which I noticed a significant surge in callbacks from companies. He also taught me most of what I know about technical interviews. One can easily tell that Helal not only has a passion for software development, but also a passion for helping others in his field."

He replied promptly agreeing to a phone call, and during that phone call he dove into the technical and behavioral aspects of the interview that I should be prepared for, and it was his insight and advice that I believe really helped me be best prepared for the interview. I actually got the position at my dream company! He is super knowledgeable and always willing to help."

Whenever I needed any support or suggestions for software engineering or AWS, he was more than happy to help. I was very fascinated by his humbleness and generosity. Which has encouraged me to get more of his guidance. I know Rageeb before he even started working with J.P Morgan, as of now he‚Äôs working with Amazon. Despite having a lot of achievements, he‚Äôs still the same humble and generous person as I met him in 2018. We need more people like Rageeb, who could positively influence other people to become successful."

Without him, I do not think I would be graduating in 4 years because he introduced me to the Student Ambassadors Program, which offered early registration for classes. This ultimately lead me to be able to comfortably enroll in classes with the best professors. Yasin also opened my eyes up to the ‚Äúreal world‚Äù of Computer Science. He made me realize that the industry is incredibly competitive and I will need more than a degree to get a job. He advised me to join Hackathons, work on personal projects, and apply for internships. I could not have made it this far in my journey without the mentorship of Yasin."

With this serious lack of Colleges taking initiatives to give students practical knowledge of how to secure a position in top companies, we felt it is time to give back the culmination of our experiences to the communities we were once in. The Headstarter seminars will aim to guide students through every step of their college and professional career such that they are equipped with everything they need to land their dream job."
