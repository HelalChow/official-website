      message: "I can confidently say Yasin has been, and still is my biggest mentor at Queens College. Without him, I do not think I would be graduating in 4 years because he introduced me to the Student Ambassadors Program, which offered early registration for classes. This ultimately lead me to be able to comfortably enroll in classes with the best professors. Yasin also opened my eyes up to the ‚Äúreal world‚Äù of Computer Science. He made me realize that the industry is incredibly competitive and I will need more than a degree to get a job. He advised me to join Hackathons, work on personal projects, and apply for internships. I could not have made it this far in my journey without the mentorship of Yasin."
